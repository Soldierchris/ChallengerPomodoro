> The inventor of this technique was Francesco Cirillo, an Italian student who realized how unproductive not only his study sessions were, but those of all his classmates in general.
>
> The Pomodoro technique, or Pomodoro method, is a tool for both study and work. In fact, as a more precise way of definition, we can say that it is a productivity methodology.

>The basis of this technique is to divide time into periods of 25 minutes. Not a minute more, not a minute less. Because? Because what is sought with this technique is to achieve what is called the ‚Äúfocus of concentration‚Äù: that state of focus in which you are only focused on finishing the task at hand, without distractions of any kind.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install
Later, tailwindcss is installed in its specific versions, placing dp --save-dev so that it is saved in the dependencies  

$ npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react  

$ npm install npx  


Later, tailwindcss is installed in its specific versions, placing dp --save-dev so that it is saved in the dependencies  



$ npm install --save-dev lucide-react  
$ npm install --save-dev tailwindcss@3.1.8  
$ npm install --save-dev autoprefixer@10.4.8  
$ npm install --save-dev postcss@8.4.16  


Later we execute from the CLI:  
npx tailwindcss init -p    
When the previous statement is executed, two files are created:  

Created Tailwind CSS config file: tailwind.config.js  
Created PostCSS config file: postcss.config.js  

Initially shown without routes that Tailwindcss would use

</div>

We assign the paths of the files they will use tailwindcss:  
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],  

Finally it would look like this:  

<div align="center">

![alt text](src/assets/image-3.png)
</div>

The main.jsx file points to index.css, we indicate that index.css will use tailwinddcss by placing the following paths:   

@tailwind base;  
@tailwind components;  
@tailwind utilities;
